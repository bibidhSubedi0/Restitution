# Particle Simulation with Gravity and Friction

This project simulates a particle moving under the influence of wind, gravity, friction, and restitution. The particle interacts with a platform, bouncing off it while exhibiting realistic physics behavior.

## Features:
- **Gravity**: A constant downward force.
- **Wind**: A constant horizontal velocity applied to the particle.
- **Friction**: Reduces the particle's horizontal velocity over time.
- **Restitution**: The particle bounces off the platform with a reduced velocity.
